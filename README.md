# Car Manager
### Introduction
This is a simple Car Manager App. Actually, it's not so useful, but this is **my first app written in Java**. This is also the first app, that I published on GitHub and the first app written in MVC. So, I'm gonna keep this app here, because I'm sentimental. 

The project is unfinished, because I ran out of ideas and didn't know what to add. I made this app, because I wanted to learn the basics of Java programming and Swing GUI. 

### Features 

  - displaying the list of cars in a JTable
  - "Add a new car" option
  - "Delete the car" option
  - "Load a list of cars from CSV file" option
  - "Save the list of cars to CSV file" option

### Future options
- sort by name/top speed/etc.
- add a filter
- search for a car
